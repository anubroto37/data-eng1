    "Recreate the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold layers)** in **MySQL** using the same data, transformations, and logic previously implemented in **Spark SQL**. The original workflow included creating the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers, followed by **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the processed data.  \n"

    "1. **Data Setup**  \n",
    "   - Load the original dataset into MySQL tables representing the **Bronze layer**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Transformation**  \n",
    "   - Apply transformations to create the **Silver layer**, cleaning and refining the data.  \n",
    "   - Generate the **Gold layer** with aggregated or final business-ready data.  \n",

    "3. **EDA in MySQL**  \n",
    "   - Run SQL queries to analyze the data at each layer, similar to the EDA performed in Spark SQL.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Validation**  \n",
    "   - Ensure the output of each layer matches the logic and results from the original Spark SQL implementation.  \n"
